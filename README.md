I recently got an #assignment from Gaurav Sir for an interview assessment. I really appreciate him giving me this opportunity.

At first glance, the task seemed straightforward, but as I dug in, I realized there was a lot to learn from it.

For the ##revenue analysis part, I decided to use Python. It let me show off my skills in basic data cleaning, changing data types, and checking for missing values. Luckily, I didn't need to fill in any missing data for this assignment. This part wasn't too challenging.

The cohort analysis was where things got interesting. I mainly used PostgreSQL with pgAdmin 4 to tackle this efficiently. I also tried using Microsoft Excel 365 on my MacBook, but that was tricky because it's missing some features I needed.

pgAdmin was great for this problem. I got to use CTEs (Common Table Expressions) with recursive queries, which was fun and helped me brush up on some concepts I hadn't used in a while.

One thing I learned is how important it is to use date functions effectively when working with e-commerce data.

Overall, it was a good mix of familiar tasks and new challenges that pushed me to think creatively.

##To figure out how quickly customers come back to buy from the same product category, we'd do this:

1. Look at our data: We have info on orders, what's in each order, and product details spread across three tables.

2. Connect the dots: We'll join these tables to see who bought what and when.

3. Spot the repeats: For each customer, we'll line up their orders by date for each product category.

4. Measure the gaps: We'll calculate how many days pass between orders in the same category.

5. Get the average: We'll find the average time it takes for customers to come back to each category.

6. Use SQL smartly: We can write a query that does all this efficiently, using some clever SQL functions to handle the date comparisons and averages.

7. Think bigger: Once we have this info, we could use it to spot trends, like which products bring customers back quickest, or which customers are our most frequent repeat buyers.

This approach gives us a clear picture of customer buying habits, which could really help with things like planning promotions or managing stock.

on top i wrote one sql query for basic implementation.
